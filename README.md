## Usage
  
```
git clone https://github.com/zhangjszs/HUAT-kerwin-labwork.git
cd HUAT-kerwin-labwork
```
Each repository has two folders, `report` and `code`. The `report` folder contains the `lab reports`, while the `code folder` contains the lab code. Within the code repository, there are three versions: `Basic Edition`, `Rsssis Edition`, and `Challenge Edition`, which are required by the school. Most of the code can be run directly from the `main function`. Some later parts are implemented using Python for visualization, and can also be run by executing their `main function`.
